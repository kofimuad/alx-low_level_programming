# HELLO WORLD

This would contain projects in C. This would be the first few tasks I do in C.

## Task 0 - Preprocessor

A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file
The C file name would be saved in the variable '$CFILE' and the output would be into the file 'c'
