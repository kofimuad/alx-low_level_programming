# HELLO WORLD

This would contain projects in C. This would be the first few tasks I do in C.

## Task 0 - Preprocessor

A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file
The C file name would be saved in the variable '$CFILE' and the output would be into the file 'c'

## Task 1 - Compiler

A script that compiles a C file but does not link. You are going to get an object code.
We are going to use the -c flag for gcc and we want out output to be .o instead of .c so we would use shell parameter expansion for that.

## Task 2 - Assembler

A script that generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it into an output file.
We are going to use the -S flag for gcc and we want out output to be .s instead of .c so we would use shell parameter expansion for that.
