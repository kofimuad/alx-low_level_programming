# HELLO WORLD

This would contain projects in C. This would be the first few tasks I do in C.

## Task 0 - Preprocessor

A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file
The C file name would be saved in the variable '$CFILE' and the output would be into the file 'c'

## Task 1 - Compiler

A script that compiles a C file but does not link. You are going to get an object code.
We are going to use the -c flag for gcc and we want out output to be .o instead of .c so we would use shell parameter expansion for that.

## Task 2 - Assembler

A script that generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it into an output file.
We are going to use the -S flag for gcc and we want out output to be .s instead of .c so we would use shell parameter expansion for that.

## Task 3 - Name
A script that compiles a C file and creates an executable called cisfun

## Task 4 - Hello, puts
A C program that used puts to print "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzule" followed by a new line

## Task 5 - Hello, printf
a C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line. - Use printf function.

## Task 6 - Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation
A C program that prints the various types on the computer it is compiled on. sizeof() is used and %d for int output.

## Task 7 - Intel
A script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.
