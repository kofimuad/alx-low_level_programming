# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

This is the last project I think on pointers.

## Task 0 - 0. memset
A function that fills the memory with a constant byte.

## Task 1 - 1.memcpy
A function that copies memoery area. ```dest[i] = src[i]```

## Task 2 - strchr
A function that locates a character in a string. 
- ```s``` pointer to a string.
- ```c``` character to be located.

## Task 3 - strspn
A function that gets the length of a prefix substring

## Task 4 - strpbrk
A function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes
- ```s```string to be search.
- ```accept```string to be compared to string ```s```.
return a pointer to the particular character (byte) that matches one of the byte in ```accept```.
