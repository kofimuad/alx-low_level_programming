# Variables, if, else, while
This readme contains documentation for all tasks for this project. Alx for conditional statements and control structures.

## Task 0 - Positive anything is better than negative nothing
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code 
in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative. - use of if else if and else statement.

## Task 1 - The last digit
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n. - Used the n % 10 to find the last digit.

## Task 2 - I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
In this task we are using putchar and only putchar to print the letters of the alphabet followed by a new line.
To do this I would employ a for loop. 

## Task 3 - alphABET
In this code we need to print the alphabet in lower followed by upper case and we just use putchar 3 times.

## Task 4 - When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
A code that prints all alphabets except q and e, we are going to use a conditional.

## Task 5 - Numbers
A program that prints all single digit numbers. followed by a new line.

## Task 6 - Numberz
A program that prints all single digit numbers but this time you are restricted to use 2 putchars. Here, I would employ converting the int into 
its ascii character value. 

## Task 7 - Smile in the mirror
A program that prints lowercase alphabets in reverse followed by a new line.

## Task 8 - Hexadecimal
A script that prints in lowercase all the numbers in base 16. Hexadecimal numbers are from 1 to 9 and A to F.
